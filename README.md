# Project01 King of the Hill!
First Project01
Mission Statement:  This app will take in a users name, location, and choosen activity (bike,run) and use the strava, and google Maps API to output the 10 most frequented segments within 10 miles, along with the next 7 day forecast so that users can plan when to take on the king of the hill of each segment!

Further options: We would like to set up user log in for this app, and the ablity to add friends, and challenge them to segments.
